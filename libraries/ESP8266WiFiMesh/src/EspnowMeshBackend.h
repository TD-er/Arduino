// ESP-NOW is faster for small data payloads (up to a few kB, split over multiple messages). Transfer of up to 234 bytes takes 4 ms.
// In general ESP-NOW transfer time can be approximated with the following function: transferTime = ceil(bytesToTransfer / 234.0)*3 ms.
// If you only transfer 234 bytes at a time, this adds up to around 56kB/s. Finally a chance to relive the glory of the olden days
// when people were restricted to V90 dial-up modems for internet access!
// TCP-IP takes longer to connect (around 1000 ms), and an AP has to disconnect all connected stations in order to transfer data to another AP, 
// but this backend has a much higher data transfer speed than ESP-NOW once connected (100x faster or so).

/**
 * This ESP-NOW framework uses a few different message types to enable easier interpretation of transmissions. 
 * The message type is stored in the first transmission byte, see EspnowProtocolInterpreter.h for more detailed information on the protocol.
 * Available message types are 'Q' for question (request), 'A' for answer (response), 
 * 'B' for broadcast, 'S' for synchronization request, 'P' for peer request and 'C' for peer request confirmation.
 * 
 * 'B', 'Q' and 'A' are the message types that are assigned to data transmitted by the user. 
 * 'S', 'P' and 'C' are used only for internal framework transmissions.
 * 
 * Messages with type 'B' are only used for broadcasts. They cannot be encrypted.
 * 
 * Messages with type 'Q' are used for requests sent by the user. They can be encrypted.
 * 
 * Messages with type 'A' are used for responses given by the user when 'B' or 'Q' messages have been received. They can be encrypted.
 *
 * Messages with type 'P' and 'C' are used exclusively for automatically pairing two ESP-NOW nodes to each other.
 * This enables flexible easy-to-use encrypted ESP-NOW communication. 'P' and 'C' messages can be encrypted. 
 * The encryption pairing process works as follows (from top to bottom):
 * 
 *  Encryption pairing process, schematic overview: 
 * 
 *     Connection   |         Peer sends ('C'):           |    Peer requester sends ('P'):   |    Connection
 *     encrypted:   |                                     |                                  |    encrypted:
 *                  |                                     |    Peer request + Nonce + HMAC   |
 *                  |       StaMac + Nonce + HMAC         |                                  |
 *                  |                                     |              Ack                 |
 *          X       |   SessionKeys + Nonce + Password    |                                  |        X
 *          X       |                                     |              Ack                 |        X
 *          X       |                                     |           SessionKey             |        X
 *          X       |               Ack                   |                                  |        X
 *                  |                                     |                                  |
 *  
 *  
 * The ESP-NOW CCMP encryption should have replay attack protection built in, 
 * but since there is no official documentation from Espressif about this a 128 bit random nonce is included in encrypted connection requests.
 * 
 * Messages with type 'S' are used exclusively when we try to send an encrypted 'R' or 'P' transmission and the last such transmission we tried failed to receive an ack. 
 * Since we then do not know if the receiving node has incremented its corresponding session key or not, we first send an 'S' request to make sure the key is incremented.
 * Once we get an ack for our 'S' request we send the new encrypted 'R' or 'P' transmission. 'S' messages are always encrypted.
 * 
 * Messages of type 'A' and 'C' are response types, and thus use the same session key as the corresponding 'R' and 'P' message they are responding to.
 * This means they can never cause a desynchronization to occur, and therefore they do not trigger 'S' messages.
 *
