// ESP-NOW is faster for small data payloads (up to a few kB, split over multiple messages). Transfer of up to 234 bytes takes 4 ms.
// In general ESP-NOW transfer time can be approximated with the following function: transferTime = ceil(bytesToTransfer / 234.0)*3 ms.
// If you only transfer 234 bytes at a time, this adds up to around 56kB/s. Finally a chance to relive the glory of the olden days
// when people were restricted to V90 dial-up modems for internet access!
// TCP-IP takes longer to connect (around 1000 ms), and an AP has to disconnect all connected stations in order to transfer data to another AP, 
// but this backend has a much higher data transfer speed than ESP-NOW once connected (100x faster or so).
