/**
   NOTE: Although we could define the strings below as normal String variables,
   here we are using PROGMEM combined with the FPSTR() macro (and also just the F() macro further down in the file).
   The reason is that this approach will place the strings in flash memory which will help save RAM during program execution.
   Reading strings from flash will be slower than reading them from RAM,
   but this will be a negligible difference when printing them to Serial.

   More on F(), FPSTR() and PROGMEM:
